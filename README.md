**cLiri**

welcome to cLiri - a command-line interface language interpreter! this interpreter doesn't understand much, but if you've got a song that's been playing in your head all day, a movie you've been dying to look up, some tweets you wanna see styled up, or just wanna check some stuff out then this is the program for you!


first, you're gonna wanna execute this command in your cli :

```
npm install
```

this program takes a few commands. here are some examples :

```
node cliri omdb pulp fiction
node cliri spotify dna
node cliri tweets
```

test those out before trying some of your own!
